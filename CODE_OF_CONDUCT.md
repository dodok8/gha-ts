# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The gaji project is committed to building a community where everyone is welcomed and can participate safely.

This Code of Conduct sets minimum standards to ensure all participants are respected equally, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, age, social status, education, knowledge level, appearance, disability, or illness.

We believe that better software is built when people with diverse backgrounds and experiences come together.
